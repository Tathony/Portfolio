                            INNATE: Syndra collects Splinters of Wrath that enhance each of her abilities based on the
                            number of them collected,
                            stacking up to 120 times. She gains Splinters of Wrath from the following:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Dealing two instances of ability damage to an enemy champion within 4 seconds grants 1 /
                                2 / 3 (based on level) Splinters.
                                This cannot occur on the same target more than once every 8 seconds.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ranking up an ability with any skill points beyond level 1 grants 5 Splinters, up to 85.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Killing a large minion grants 1 Splinter.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        Collecting a Splinter of Wrath from an enemy restores Mana icon 20 - 215 (based on level) mana.
                        Splinters of Wrath are brought to Syndra from enemies over 0.6 seconds.
                        At 120 Splinters of Wrath, Syndra achieves Transcendence, increasing her Ability power icon
                        ability power by 15%.
                        Syndra can collect Splinters of Wrath from enemies even if she is at maximum stacks. These
                        Splinters do not grant any stacks, but will still restore mana for Syndra.
